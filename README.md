Welcome to the FriendFinder App!

With just a few steps, you can find a person out there that's your perfect match!

How it works: 
From the FriendFinder website, users will enter:
1) Name and a link to their profile picture (Required).
2) Answer 10 questions about themselves.

Each question is assigned a value, and all ten values are aggragated into an overall value. This overall value is them compared to other overall values from other profiles. Users with similar overall values will then be matched one-to-one. A pop-up window will display the name and profile picture of the perfect match!
